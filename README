This is a stripped-down version of the famous fakeroot tool targeting
MacOS X exclusively. 

Fakeroot-mini enables XCode users to build packages containing items
owned by root (ex: KEXT development) directly from the IDE with zero
additional software installed.

Following are the key features:
1. No installation, just a single interposing DYLIB.
2. No daemon process, the state is stored in extended file attributes.

A project willing to utilize fakeroot-mini is going to put the single
interposing DYLIB in the project's repository. Add the following lines
in project configuration:

FAKEROOTENV=/usr/bin/env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=$(SRCROOT)/<..>/libfakermini.dylib
CHOWN=$(FAKEROOTENV) $(inherited)

And invoke tools normally requiring root like that:

$(FAKEROOTENV) <tool> <arguments> 


=== Portability Notes ===

On OS X, only binaries that do NOT rely on Mach-based [e]uid/[e]gid/mode
APIs will correctly use fakeroot altered ownership/permissions.
See README_MACOSX.txt for further information.
